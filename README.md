# sgmenu

`sgmenu` is a launcher application targetting the Sway window manager. It
is similar to applications such as `dmenu` and `rofi`. 

## Building

To build `sgmenu`, you must have installed the `gtk-layer-shell` libraries.

After that, the standard Rust build commands work such as `cargo build`, 
`cargo run`, etc.
